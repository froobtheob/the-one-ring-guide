**Lore** reflects a hero's love for learning and knowledge in areas such as:

- Distant lands and cultures  
- Family genealogy or historical facts  

A **Lore** test is needed whenever a hero seeks information or applies their knowledge. Heroes are usually well-versed in the traditions of their own people, so the Loremaster rarely requires a **Lore** roll for things related to the heroâ€™s Culture, Background, or homeland.

### Key Points
