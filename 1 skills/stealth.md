**Stealth** allows a hero to:

- Act in a secretive or furtive manner  
- Hide, move quietly, or shadow others  

Stealthy heroes rely on quickness, precision, and timing to carry out their tasks unnoticed. Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters often use this skill to thrive in their trade.

### Outcomes of Stealth Rolls
- **Success**: The hero moves unnoticed or remains hidden.  
- **Failure**: The hero likely attracts unwanted attention.  
- **Superior Success**: The heroâ€™s actions are so flawless that the deed may go unnoticed even after the fact.
