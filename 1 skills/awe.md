- Evoke respect or admiration  
- Make a strong impression on others  

A hero with a high **Awe** skill can inspire wonder, admiration, or even fear, depending on the situation and their intentions. This skill comes from a heroâ€™s natural charisma but can also be amplified by dramatic entrances or impressive attire.
