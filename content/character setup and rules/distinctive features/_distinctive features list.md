#### **Rules and Mechanics**
- **Changing a Distinctive Feature**:  
  After long-term play, players may want to update their character's traits:  
  - This can be done during a **Yule Fellowship Phase** by choosing the **Recount a Story Undertaking**.  
  - Replacing a trait requires common sense to avoid completely reinventing the character.
