**Persuade** is the skill to:

- Use reasoning and eloquence to convince others of an idea or course of action  
- Influence small groups, especially in settings like common halls  

**Persuade** takes more time than other Personality [[skills]] but can have a lasting effect on people’s actions. Heroes with a high **Persuade** score are often eloquent speakers, skilled in the art of persuasion, and can sway others with their words.

- **Failure**: May fail to change others' minds or even backfire.  
- **Superior Success**: Makes the hero’s argument compelling enough to turn listeners into strong supporters.
