**Scan** allows a hero to:

- Examine something closely or attentively  
- Skim through books for information, search for hidden doors or inscriptions, recognize faces in a crowd, or find tracks  

**Scan** rolls are typically initiated by players and are used to inspect small areas, like a room. Unlike **[[awareness]]**, which is for passive noticing, **Scan** is used for focused searches.

### Outcomes of Scan Rolls
- **Success**: Finds what the hero is searching for, if itâ€™s there.  
- **Failure**: May miss the object or detail being sought.  
- **Superior Success**: Finds the object more quickly or efficiently.
