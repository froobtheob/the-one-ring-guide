During character creation, all players calculate three **Target Numbers (TNs)** using a Player-heroâ€™s **STRENGTH**, **HEART**, and **WITS**. These scores are annotated on the relevant spaces on the character sheet. 

These TNs are used to take the Attributes of a hero into account when resolving most rolls.
