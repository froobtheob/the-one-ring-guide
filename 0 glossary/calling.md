A **Calling** is what motivates the Player-heroes to seek a life of adventure and keeps them on that dangerous path every day. There are six different Callings to choose from, each one exemplifying a different adventurous drive. 

Player-heroes can be:  
- **Captains**  
- **Champions**  
- **Messengers**  
- **Scholars**  
- **Treasure Hunters**  
- **Wardens**  

Callings let players customize their character concepts and help them focus on the beliefs and goals that give them a sense of purpose.
